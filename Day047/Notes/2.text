// 32-Bit vs 64-Bit OS 


1. A 32-bit OS has 32-bit registers, and it can access 2^32 unique memory addresses. i.e., 4GB of physical memory. 
2. A 64-bit OS has 64-bit registers, and it can access 2^64 unique memory addresses. i.e., 17,179,869,184 GB of physical memory. 
3. 32-bit CPU architecture can process 32 bits of data & information. 
4. 64-bit CPU architecture can process 64 bits of data & information. 
5. Advantages of 64-bit over the 32-bit operating system: 

a. Addressable Memory: 32-bit CPU -> 2^32 memory addresses, 64-bit CPU -> 2^64 memory addresses. 
b. Resource usage: Installing more RAM on a system with a 32-bit OS doesn't impact performance. However, upgrade that system with excess RAM to the 64-bit version of Windows, and you'll notice a difference. 
c. Performance: All calculations take place in the registers. When youâ€™re performing math in your code, operands are loaded from memory into registers. So, having larger registers allow you to perform larger calculations at the same time. 
32-bit processor can execute 4 bytes of data in 1 instruction cycle while 64-bit means that processor can execute 8 bytes of data in 1 instruction cycle. 
(In 1 sec, there could be thousands to billons of instruction cycles depending upon a processor design) 
d. Compatibility: 64-bit CPU can run both 32-bit and 64-bit OS. While
